# CorpusThesis
I created this repository to upload the files related to the corpus of my master’s thesis. 
The supervisor of my thesis project is Professor **Silvia Luraghi**.
The XML files related to the texts in my corpus were downloaded from the **Perseus Digital Library** (https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/).
The scripts used were created by Professor **Volker Gast**.
The texts were parsed using **Stanza** (https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/).
