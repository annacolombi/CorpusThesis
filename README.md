# CorpusThesis
I created this repository to upload the files related to the corpus of my master’s thesis.  
The supervisor of my thesis project is Professor **Silvia Luraghi**  
The XML files related to the texts in my corpus were downloaded from the **Perseus Digital Library** (https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/)    
The scripts used were created by Professor **Volker Gast**  
The texts were parsed using **Stanza** (https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/)  

The file called _abl_abs_features_matched.xlsx_ shows an example of how I am working: once the texts have been parsed, the ablative absolutes identified by the automatic parsing (and later the cum + subjunctive / cum + ablative constructions) are placed into another Excel file, where they are checked manually.
