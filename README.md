# CorpusThesis
I created this repository to upload the files related to the corpus of my master’s thesis.  
The supervisor of my thesis project is Professor **Silvia Luraghi**  
The XML files related to the texts in my corpus were downloaded from the **Perseus Digital Library** (https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/)    
The scripts used were created by Professor **Volker Gast**  
The texts were parsed using **Stanza** (https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/)  

The files with an Excel extension contain the extracted features (of the ablative absolute or cum + subjunctive). They were analysed by marking in green the full ablative absolutes, in pink those occurrences in which a sentence contains more than one ablative absolute but they were split, and in red the errors.
